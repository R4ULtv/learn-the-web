title: Core Responsibilities of a Server-Side Language
description: What Does Your Code Need to Handle?
---

Now that you've seen several popular server-side languages, let's zoom out and consider the common responsibilities that _all_ of these languages need to handle when building a back-end application.
Regardless of whether you're writing Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, or Go, your server-side code will typically be responsible for the following tasks:

## Handling Incoming Requests

This is the fundamental task of any server-side application.
The code needs to:

- **Receive HTTP Requests:** Listen for incoming requests from clients (usually web browsers or mobile apps).
- **Parse Requests:** Extract information from the request, such as the URL, request method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and any data sent in the request body.

Different languages and frameworks provide different tools and APIs for handling incoming requests.

## Routing

Once a request has been received and parsed, the server needs to determine what to do with it.
This is where routing comes in.
Routing involves mapping URLs to specific functions or handlers within your code.

- **Define Routes:** Specify which code should be executed for different URLs and request methods.
- **Handle Dynamic Routes:** Support URLs with variables or parameters that need to be extracted and used by the handler.

## Processing Data

A significant portion of back-end code involves processing data.
This might include:

- **Validating Data:** Ensure that data received from clients is valid and meets the expected format and constraints.
- **Transforming Data:** Convert data from one format to another (e.g., from JSON to XML).
- **Performing Calculations:** Execute business logic and calculations based on the data.

## Interacting with Databases

Most web applications require persistent storage for data.
Server-side languages need to provide mechanisms for interacting with databases:

- **Connecting to Databases:** Establish connections to various types of databases (relational, NoSQL, etc.).
- **Querying Data:** Retrieve data from the database based on specific criteria.
- **Updating Data:** Insert, update, and delete data in the database.
- **Using ORMs (Optional):** Employ Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to simplify database interactions by mapping database tables to objects in your code.

## Generating Responses

After processing a request, the server needs to send a response back to the client.
This involves:

- **Creating HTTP Responses:** Construct a well-formed HTTP response, including a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and appropriate headers.
- **Serializing Data:** Convert data into a format suitable for transmission over the network (e.g., JSON or XML).
- **Rendering Templates:** Generate HTML code dynamically using a templating engine.

## Handling Authentication and Authorization

Security is paramount for most web applications.
Back-end code needs to handle:

- **User Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users (e.g., using usernames and passwords).
- **User Authorization:** Controlling access to resources based on user roles or permissions.
- **Session Management:** Maintaining user sessions across multiple requests.

## Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential for building reliable applications:

- **Catching Exceptions:** Handle unexpected errors or exceptions that occur during code execution.
- **Logging Errors:** Record errors to a log file or other monitoring system.
- **Returning Error Responses:** Send appropriate error responses to the client, including informative error messages.

## Asynchronous Operations

Many server-side tasks, such as database queries or network requests, are asynchronous.
Server-side languages need to provide mechanisms for handling these operations efficiently without blocking the main thread:

- **Using Threads or Processes:** Spawn new threads or processes to handle long-running tasks in parallel.
- **Using Asynchronous I/O:** Employ non-blocking I/O operations to handle multiple requests concurrently.
- **Using Promises or Async/Await:** Simplify asynchronous code with promises or async/await syntax.

## Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are crucial for tracking the health and performance of your application:

- **Logging Events:** Record important events, such as user actions or system events, to a log file or other monitoring system.
- **Tracking Performance Metrics:** Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as request latency, CPU usage, and memory usage.

By understanding these core responsibilities, you can better appreciate the challenges and complexities of back-end development, regardless of the specific language or framework you choose.
