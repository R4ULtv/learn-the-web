title: CRUD Operations
description: The Foundation of Data Manipulation
---

You've designed your database, defining the structure and relationships between your data.
Now, it's time to learn how to interact with that data: how to create, read, update, and delete records.
These four fundamental operations are collectively known as **CRUD**.

CRUD operations are the foundation of data manipulation in almost any application.
Understanding how to perform these operations efficiently and securely is essential for back-end developers.

## The Four Core Operations

- **Create (Insert):** Adding new records to your database.
  This operation involves inserting data into one or more tables to create a new entity.
- **Read (Select):** Retrieving existing records from your database.
  This operation involves querying the database to fetch specific data based on certain criteria.
- **Update (Modify):** Modifying existing records in your database.
  This operation involves changing the values of specific columns or fields in a table or document.
- **Delete (Remove):** Removing records from your database.
  This operation involves deleting rows from a table or documents from a collection.

## CRUD in Relational Databases

In relational databases, you perform CRUD operations using SQL statements.
Here are some examples:

```sql title="Create (Insert)"
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('john.doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'hashed_password');
```

This SQL statement inserts a new row into the `users` table with the specified values for the `username`, `email`, and `password` columns.

```sql title="Read (Select)"
SELECT user_id, username, email
FROM users
WHERE username = 'john.doe';
```

This SQL statement retrieves the `user_id`, `username`, and `email` columns from the `users` table for the user with the username "john.doe".

```sql title="Update (Update)"
UPDATE users
SET email = 'john.newemail@example.com'
WHERE user_id = 123;
```

This SQL statement updates the `email` column in the `users` table for the user with the `user_id` of 123.

```sql title="Delete (Delete)"
DELETE FROM users
WHERE user_id = 123;
```

This SQL statement deletes the row from the `users` table for the user with the `user_id` of 123.

## CRUD in NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases use different query languages and APIs for performing CRUD operations.
Here are some examples using MongoDB:

```javascript title="Create (Insert)"
db.users.insertOne({
  username: "john.doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  password: "hashed_password",
});
```

This command inserts a new document into the `users` collection with the specified values.

```javascript title="Read (Find)"
db.users.find({ username: "john.doe" });
```

This command retrieves all documents from the `users` collection where the `username` is "john.doe".

```javascript title="Update (Update)"
db.users.updateOne(
  { user_id: 123 },
  { $set: { email: "john.newemail@example.com" } }
);
```

This command updates the `email` field in the document with the `user_id` of 123.

```javascript title="Delete (Delete)"
db.users.deleteOne({ user_id: 123 });
```

This command deletes the document with the `user_id` of 123 from the `users` collection.

## Important Considerations

- **Security:** Always sanitize user input and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Transactions:** Use transactions to ensure data consistency when performing multiple CRUD operations.
- **Performance:** Optimize your queries and use indexes to improve performance, especially for large datasets.
- **ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers):** Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) can simplify database interactions by mapping database tables to objects in your code.
  However, it's important to understand the underlying SQL queries that the ORM generates to optimize performance.

Mastering CRUD operations is a fundamental skill for any back-end developer.
It's the key to building applications that can store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently and securely.
