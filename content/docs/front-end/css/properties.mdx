description: The Building Blocks of CSS Styling
---

You've learned about [CSS selectors](./selectors), which allow you to target specific HTML elements. Now, let's dive into **CSS properties**, which are the building blocks of CSS styling. Properties are the individual aspects of an element's appearance that you can control, like its color, font, size, and position. Each property has a name (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`) and a value (e.g., `blue`, `16px`, `10px`).

Think of CSS properties as the knobs and dials that you use to adjust the look and feel of your web pages.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for setting a CSS property is:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

For example:

```css
p {
  color: blue; /* Sets the text color of all paragraph elements to blue */
}
```

## Common CSS Properties

There are _many_ CSS properties, and you don't need to memorize them all at once. Let's explore some of the most common and useful ones, grouped by category:

### Text Properties

- **`color`:** Sets the text color.

```css
p {
  color: #333; /* Dark gray */
}
```

- **`font-size`:** Sets the size of the font. Common units include `px` (pixels), `em` (relative to the font size of the parent element), and `rem` (relative to the font size of the root element).

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2em; /* Twice the size of the parent element's font */
}
```

- **`font-family`:** Specifies the font to use. You can specify multiple fonts as a fallback in case the browser doesn't have one available.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
}
```

- **`font-weight`:** Sets the weight (boldness) of the font. Common values include `normal`, `bold`, `lighter`, `bolder`, and numeric values (e.g., `400` for normal, `700` for bold).

```css
strong {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

- **`text-align`:** Sets the horizontal alignment of text. Common values include `left`, `right`, `center`, and `justify`.

```css
h1 {
  text-align: center; /* Centers the heading */
}
```

- **`line-height`:** Sets the height of a line of text. A value without units (e.g., `1.5`) is usually best, as it's relative to the font size.

```css
p {
  line-height: 1.5; /* Improves readability */
}
```

### Background Properties

- **`background-color`:** Sets the background color of an element.

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background */
}
```

- **`background-image`:** Sets a background image for an element.

```css
body {
  background-image: url("background.jpg");
}
```

- **`background-repeat`:** Specifies how the background image should be repeated. Common values include `repeat`, `no-repeat`, `repeat-x`, and `repeat-y`.

```css
body {
  background-image: url("pattern.png");
  background-repeat: repeat; /* Repeats the pattern in both directions */
}
```

- **`background-position`:** Specifies the position of the background image.

```css
body {
  background-image: url("logo.png");
  background-position: center top; /* Centers the logo horizontally and positions it at the top */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Box Model Properties (Very Important!)

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web development. It describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for HTML elements and how these boxes interact with each other. We have a separate page for this, refer to the [Box Model page](./box-model).

- **`width`:** Sets the width of the element's content area.
- **`height`:** Sets the height of the element's content area.
- **`padding`:** Sets the padding (space between the content and the border) on all four sides of the element.
- **`border`:** Sets the border around the element.
- **`margin`:** Sets the margin (space outside the border) on all four sides of the element.

### Layout Properties

- **`display`:** Specifies the display type of an element. Common values include `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, `grid`, and `none`. Layout properties will be on its own separate page, check out the [Layout page](./layout).

```css
li {
  display: inline; /* Displays list items on the same line */
}
```

- **`position`:** Specifies the positioning method used for an element. Common values include `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`. The positioning property will also be on the [Layout page](./layout).

- **`float`:** Floats an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text and other inline elements to wrap around it.

```css
img {
  float: left; /* Floats the image to the left */
  margin-right: 10px; /* Adds some space to the right of the image */
}
```

### Border Properties

- **`border-width`:** Sets the width of the border.

```css
div {
  border-width: 2px; /* Sets a 2-pixel wide border */
}
```

- **`border-style`:** Sets the style of the border. Common values include `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `double`, and `none`.

```css
div {
  border-style: solid; /* Sets a solid border */
}
```

- **`border-color`:** Sets the color of the border.

```css
div {
  border-color: #000; /* Sets a black border */
}
```

- **`border`:** A shorthand property for setting the `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color` in a single declaration.

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid #ccc; /* Sets a 1-pixel solid gray border */
}
```

### Other Properties

- **`cursor`:** Specifies the type of cursor to display when the mouse pointer is over an element.

```css
a {
  cursor: pointer; /* Changes the cursor to a pointer (hand) on links */
}
```

- **`opacity`:** Sets the opacity (transparency) of an element. Values range from `0` (completely transparent) to `1` (completely opaque).

```css
img {
  opacity: 0.5; /* Makes the image 50% transparent */
}
```

- **`visibility`:** Specifies whether an element is visible or hidden. Values include `visible` and `hidden`. The difference between `visibility: hidden;` and `display: none;` is that `visibility: hidden;` still takes up space on the page, while `display: none;` removes the element from the page layout entirely.

```css
#disclaimer {
  visibility: hidden; /* Hides the disclaimer, but it still takes up space */
}
```

## Shorthand Properties

Many CSS properties have shorthand versions that allow you to set multiple values in a single declaration. We saw an example with the `border` property. Here are some other common shorthand properties:

- **`margin` and `padding`:** You can use these to set the top, right, bottom, and left margins/paddings in a single declaration.

```css
div {
  margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top right bottom left */
  padding: 5px 10px; /* top/bottom left/right */
}
```

- **`font`:** You can use this to set the `font-style`, `font-variant`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family` in a single declaration.

```css
p {
  font: italic bold 16px/1.5 Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Units in CSS

CSS properties often require you to specify units. Here are some of the most common units:

- **Absolute Units:**
  - `px` (pixels): Represents a fixed size on the screen.
  - `pt` (points): Traditionally used for print media.
- **Relative Units:**
  - `em`: Relative to the font size of the parent element.
  - `rem`: Relative to the font size of the root element (`<html>`).
  - `%`: Relative to the size of the parent element.
  - `vw`: Relative to 1% of the viewport's width.
  - `vh`: Relative to 1% of the viewport's height.

Using relative units (especially `em` and `rem`) is generally recommended for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Experiment and Explore!

This is just a glimpse of the vast world of CSS properties. The best way to learn is to experiment and explore. Try changing the values of different properties and see how they affect the appearance of your web pages. Don't be afraid to consult the CSS documentation for more information.
