title: Web Servers (Software)
description: The Gatekeepers of Your Web Applications
---

You've crafted your back-end code, designed your database, and built your APIs.
But how do you make all of this accessible to the outside world? How do you actually serve your web application to users? That's where **web server software** comes in.

A web server is a piece of software that listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients (usually web browsers) and responds to those requests by serving web pages, images, and other resources.
Think of a web server as the gatekeeper of your web application, responsible for handling all incoming traffic and routing it to the appropriate resources.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

In this section, you'll explore the world of web server software, learning:

- **What is a Web Server?:** Understanding the fundamental concepts of web servers and their role in serving web applications.
- **How Web Servers Work:** Learning about the request-response cycle and how web servers process incoming requests.
- **Common Web Servers:** Exploring popular web server software like Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.
- **Web Server Configuration:** Understanding how to configure web servers to serve your applications correctly.
- **Web Server Security:** Learning about common security vulnerabilities and how to protect your web server from attacks.
- **Load Balancing:** Understanding how load balancers distribute traffic across multiple web servers to improve performance and availability.

## The Importance of Web Servers

Web server software is essential for building modern web applications because it:

- **Handles Incoming Requests:** Listens for and processes incoming HTTP requests from clients.
- **Serves Static Content:** Delivers static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images to the client.
- **Executes Server-Side Code:** Executes server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) to generate dynamic content.
- **Manages Security:** Implements security measures to protect your application from unauthorized access.
- **Provides Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.
- **It's the responsible for hosting your application in the web:** It's the technology responsible to do that.
