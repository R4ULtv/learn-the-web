description: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
---

You've decided to learn JavaScript â€“ great choice! Before you can start building complex web applications, you need to understand the fundamental building blocks of the language. This section will cover the essential basics: **variables**, **data types**, and **operators**. Think of these as the alphabet and basic grammar rules of JavaScript.

## Variables: Storing Information

A **variable** is a named storage location in your computer's memory that you can use to store data. You can think of it as a labeled box where you can put different values.

In JavaScript, you declare variables using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords:

- **`let`:** Declares a block-scoped variable. This means the variable is only accessible within the block of code where it's defined (e.g., inside an `if` statement or a `for` loop). `let` is the preferred way to declare variables in modern JavaScript.

```javascript
let message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, world!
```

- **`const`:** Declares a block-scoped constant. A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed after it's initialized. Use `const` for values that should never be reassigned.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14159

// PI = 3.14; // This will cause an error!
```

- **`var`:** Declares a function-scoped variable. This means the variable is accessible throughout the entire function where it's defined (or globally if it's defined outside of any function). `var` is an older way to declare variables, and it's generally recommended to use `let` or `const` instead. It doesn't follow the current scope standards.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  var name = "John";
  console.log(name); // Output: John
}

myFunction();
// console.log(name); // This will cause an error (name is not defined outside the function)!
```

**Recommendation:** Use `const` for variables whose values should not change and `let` for variables whose values may change. Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript.

## Data Types: Different Kinds of Values

A **data type** specifies the kind of value that a variable can hold. JavaScript has several built-in data types:

- **Number:** Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.

```javascript
let age = 30;
let price = 9.99;
```

- **String:** Represents textual data. Strings are enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"; // String concatenation
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

- **Boolean:** Represents a logical value that can be either `true` or `false`.

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = true;
let isAdult = age >= 18; // Evaluates to true if age is 18 or greater
console.log(isAdult); // Output: true
```

- **Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

```javascript
let city;
console.log(city); // Output: undefined
```

- **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of a value.

```javascript
let user = null; // User is not currently logged in
console.log(user); // Output: null
```

- **Symbol:** Represents a unique and immutable identifier (introduced in ECMAScript 2015). Symbols are often used as keys in objects.

```javascript
const mySymbol = Symbol("description");
console.log(mySymbol); // Output: Symbol(description)
```

- **Object:** Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Objects are used to store more complex data structures.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 40,
  city: "New York",
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: Bob
console.log(person.age); // Output: 40
```

- **Array:** Represents an ordered list of values.

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]); // Output: red
console.log(colors.length); // Output: 3
```

## Operators: Performing Operations on Data

**Operators** are symbols that perform operations on one or more values (operands). JavaScript has a variety of operators:

- **Arithmetic Operators:** Used to perform arithmetic calculations.
  - `+` (addition)
  - `-` (subtraction)
  - `*` (multiplication)
  - `/` (division)
  - `%` (modulo - remainder of a division)
  - `**` (exponentiation)

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x + y); // Output: 15
console.log(x - y); // Output: 5
console.log(x * y); // Output: 50
console.log(x / y); // Output: 2
console.log(x % y); // Output: 0
console.log(x ** y); // Output: 100000
```

- **Assignment Operators:** Used to assign values to variables.
  - `=` (assignment)
  - `+=` (addition assignment)
  - `-=` (subtraction assignment)
  - `*=` (multiplication assignment)
  - `/=` (division assignment)
  - `%=` (modulo assignment)

```javascript
let a = 5;
a += 10; // Equivalent to a = a + 10;
console.log(a); // Output: 15
```

- **Comparison Operators:** Used to compare two values.
  - `==` (equal to - loose comparison)
  - `===` (strict equal to - strict comparison)
  - `!=` (not equal to - loose comparison)
  - `!==` (strict not equal to - strict comparison)
  - `>` (greater than)
  - `<` (less than)
  - `>=` (greater than or equal to)
  - `<=` (less than or equal to)

```javascript
let b = 10;
let c = "10";

console.log(b == c); // Output: true (loose comparison - type coercion)
console.log(b === c); // Output: false (strict comparison - no type coercion)
console.log(b != c); // Output: false
console.log(b !== c); // Output: true
```

- **Logical Operators:** Used to combine or modify boolean expressions.
  - `&&` (logical AND)
  - `||` (logical OR)
  - `!` (logical NOT)

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = true;
let isAdmin = false;

console.log(isLoggedIn && isAdmin); // Output: false
console.log(isLoggedIn || isAdmin); // Output: true
console.log(!isLoggedIn); // Output: false
```

- **String Operators:**
  - `+` (concatenation): Used to concatenate strings.

```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // String concatenation
console.log(fullName); // Output: John Doe
```

- **Ternary Operator:** A shorthand way of writing an `if...else` statement.

```javascript
let age2 = 20;
let isAdult2 = age2 >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(isAdult2); // Output: Yes
```

## Practice and Experiment

Understanding variables, data types, and operators is essential for writing any JavaScript code. Practice using these concepts in different scenarios. The more you experiment, the better you'll understand how they work!
