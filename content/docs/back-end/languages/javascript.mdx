title: JavaScript (with Node.js)
description: Leveraging JavaScript on the Server
---

You're already familiar with JavaScript from the front-end section, where it's the language of the browser.
But JavaScript can also be a powerful force on the back-end, thanks to **Node.js**, a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers the Chrome browser.
This means you can use the same JavaScript syntax and concepts you already know from front-end development to build server-side applications.
This "JavaScript everywhere" approach can significantly reduce the learning curve and allow front-end and back-end developers to collaborate more effectively.

## Key Features of Node.js

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
  This means that it can handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the main thread, making it highly scalable and efficient for real-time applications.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js has a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and frameworks available through npm, the Node Package Manager.
  This makes it easy to find and use pre-built modules for common tasks, saving you time and effort.
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** As mentioned earlier, using JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end can simplify development and improve collaboration.
- **Large and Active Community:** Node.js has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and support available.

## When to Use Node.js

Node.js is particularly well-suited for building:

- **Real-time applications:** Chat applications, online games, and collaborative tools that require low latency and high concurrency.
- **API servers:** Building RESTful APIs for web and mobile applications.
- **Microservices:** Breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services.
- **I/O-bound applications:** Applications that spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations to complete, such as reading from a database or making network requests.

## Popular Node.js Frameworks

Several frameworks can simplify Node.js development:

- **Express.js:** A minimalist and flexible web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.
- **NestJS:** A framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
  It uses progressive JavaScript, is built and fully supports TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
- **Koa:** A lightweight framework created by the team behind Express.js, designed to be more modern and modular.

## Example: Simple Node.js HTTP Server

Here's a simple example of how to create an HTTP server using Node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1'; // Localhost
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed in a browser.

## Downsides

- **Single-Threaded:** Although Node.js is asynchronous, it runs on a single thread.
  CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop and degrade performance.
  For such tasks, consider using worker threads or another language.
- **Callback Hell (Potentially):** While promises and async/await help, poorly structured asynchronous code can still lead to complex callback chains.
- **Rapid Development:** Changes on versions and libraries might be hard to follow.

JavaScript, combined with Node.js, offers a powerful and versatile platform for building back-end applications.
Its familiar syntax, vast ecosystem, and asynchronous nature make it a popular choice for many developers.
