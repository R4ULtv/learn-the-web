title: Functions
description: Reusable Blocks of Code
---

You've learned about variables, data types, and operators - the basic building blocks of JavaScript.
Now, let's take your coding skills to the next level with **functions**.
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
They allow you to organize your code, avoid repetition, and make your programs more modular and maintainable.

Think of functions as mini-programs within your program.
They take input, perform some operations, and return output.

## What is a Function?

A function is a named block of code that can be executed multiple times.
It can take input values (called _arguments_ or _parameters_), perform some calculations or actions, and optionally return a value.

## Defining Functions

There are several ways to define functions in JavaScript:

### Function Declaration

This is the most common way to define a function.
You use the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters in parentheses `()`, and the function body enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Calling the function
let message = greet("Alice");
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Function Expression

You can also define a function as an expression and assign it to a variable.

```javascript
const greet2 = function (name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
};

// Calling the function
let message2 = greet2("Bob");
console.log(message2); // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

### Arrow Functions (ES6)

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions.
They are particularly useful for short, simple functions.

```javascript
const greet3 = (name) => {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
};

// Calling the function
let message3 = greet3("Charlie");
console.log(message3); // Output: Hello, Charlie!
```

If the arrow function has only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses:

```javascript
const square = (number) => number * number;

console.log(square(5)); // Output: 25
```

If the arrow function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces and the `return` keyword:

```javascript
const cube = (number) => number ** 3;

console.log(cube(3)); // Output: 27
```

## Function Parameters and Arguments

**Parameters** are the names you give to the input values that a function expects to receive.
They are listed in the function definition within the parentheses.

**Arguments** are the actual values that you pass to the function when you call it.

In the `greet` function example above, `name` is the parameter, and `"Alice"`, `"Bob"`, and `"Charlie"` are the arguments.

## Return Values

A function can optionally return a value using the `return` keyword.
The `return` statement ends the function's execution and specifies the value to be returned to the caller.

If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, it implicitly returns `undefined`.

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y; // Returns the sum of x and y
}

let sum = add(5, 10);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15

function doSomething() {
  // No return statement
}

let result = doSomething();
console.log(result); // Output: undefined
```

## Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
This is called _function scope_.
This helps prevent naming conflicts and keeps your code organized.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  let message = "This is a local variable";
  console.log(message); // Output: This is a local variable
}

myFunction();
// console.log(message); // This will cause an error (message is not defined outside the function)!
```

## Anonymous Functions

An anonymous function is a function that doesn't have a name.
Anonymous functions are often used as callback functions (functions that are passed as arguments to other functions).

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This message will appear after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

## Callback Functions

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be "called back" at a later time.
Callbacks are a fundamental concept in asynchronous JavaScript, often used when dealing with events, timers, or data fetched from a server.

```javascript
function greetAfterDelay(name, callback) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    let greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
    callback(greeting); // Call the callback function with the greeting
  }, 1000); // Delay of 1 second
}

// Calling the function with a callback
greetAfterDelay("Eve", function(message) {
  console.log(message); // Output: Hello, Eve! (after 1 second)
});
```

In this example, the `greetAfterDelay` function takes a `name` and a `callback` function as arguments.
After a delay of 1 second, it creates a greeting and then calls the `callback` function, passing the greeting as an argument.
The callback function then logs the greeting to the console.

## Why Use Functions?

Functions are essential for writing clean, organized, and reusable code.
They allow you to:

- **Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.**
- **Avoid repeating code.**
- **Make your code easier to read and understand.**
- **Test and debug individual parts of your code.**
- **Reuse code in different parts of your application.**

## Practice and Experiment

Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript.
Practice defining and calling functions with different parameters and return values.
Experiment with function scope and anonymous functions.
The more you use functions, the better you'll understand their power and flexibility.
