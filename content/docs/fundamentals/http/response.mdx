You've learned about HTTP request methods, which tell the server _what_ action the client wants to perform.
Now, let's look at how the server communicates the _result_ of that request back to the client.
This is done through **HTTP response status codes** - three-digit numbers that indicate whether the request was successful, and if not, what went wrong.

Think of it like a conversation:

- **Client:** "Can I have this web page?" (Sends an HTTP request with the GET method)
- **Server:** "Sure, here it is!" (Sends an HTTP response with a `200 OK` status code)
- **Or, Server:** "I can't find that page." (Sends an HTTP response with a `404 Not Found` status code)

The status code is the server's concise way of saying what happened.

## Categories of Status Codes

HTTP status codes are grouped into five categories, based on the first digit:

- **1xx (Informational):** These codes indicate that the request was received and the server is continuing to process it.
  You don't usually see these codes directly in your browser.
  - Example: `100 Continue`.

- **2xx (Successful):** These codes mean that the request was successful.
  The server received the request, understood it, and processed it without any problems.
  - Example: `200 OK` (the most common success code), `201 Created` (for successful resource creation), `204 No Content` (successful request, but no content to return).

- **3xx (Redirection):** These codes indicate that the client needs to take additional action to complete the request.
  The requested resource has moved, either temporarily or permanently.
  - Example: `301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found` (temporary redirect), `307 Temporary Redirect`, `308 Permanent Redirect`.

- **4xx (Client Error):** These codes indicate that there was a problem with the _client's_ request.
  The request might be malformed, unauthorized, or the requested resource might not exist.
  - Example: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found` (the most famous error code!), `405 Method Not Allowed`.

- **5xx (Server Error):** These codes indicate that there was a problem on the _server's_ side.
  The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
  - Example: `500 Internal Server Error`, `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `504 Gateway Timeout`.

## Common Status Codes and Their Meanings

Here are some of the most common HTTP status codes you'll encounter:

- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
  The server returned the requested resource.
- **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
- **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but there is no content to send back in the response body.
- **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
  The browser should automatically redirect to the new URL.
- **302 Found:** The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new URL.
  The browser should automatically redirect to the new URL, but should continue to use the original URL for future requests.
- **400 Bad Request:** The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires authentication.
  The client must provide valid credentials to access the resource.
- **403 Forbidden:** The server understands the request, but refuses to authorize it.
  The client does not have permission to access the resource, even with authentication.
- **404 Not Found:** The server could not find the requested resource.
  This is the most common error code.
- **405 Method Not Allowed:** The request method is not supported for the requested resource.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the server.
- **502 Bad Gateway:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from another server.
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unavailable (overloaded or down for maintenance).
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from another server.
