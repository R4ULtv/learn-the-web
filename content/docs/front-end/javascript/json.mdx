You've learned how to manipulate the DOM and respond to user events.
Now, let's explore how JavaScript can communicate with servers to fetch and send data.
**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight data-interchange format that is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a web application.
It's human-readable, easy to parse, and supported by most programming languages.

## What is JSON?

JSON is a text-based data format that uses JavaScript object syntax to represent data.
Despite its name, JSON is language-independent and can be used with any programming language.

Think of JSON as a way to serialize (convert) data into a string format that can be easily transmitted over the internet and then deserialized (converted back) into a usable data structure by the receiving application.

## JSON Syntax

JSON data is written as key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript objects:

- Data is represented in name/value pairs
- Data is separated by commas
- Curly braces `{}` hold objects
- Square brackets `[]` hold arrays

Here's an example of a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"]
}
```

## JSON Data Types

JSON supports the following data types:

- `string`: Textual data enclosed in double quotes.
- `number`: Numeric data (integers or floating-point numbers).
- `boolean`: `true` or `false` values.
- `null`: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
- `object`: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- `array`: An ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

## JSON vs. JavaScript Objects

JSON syntax is very similar to JavaScript object syntax, but there are some important differences:

- JSON keys must be enclosed in double quotes.
- JSON doesn't support JavaScript-specific data types like `undefined`, `Date`, or functions.
- JSON is a data format, while JavaScript objects are data structures.

## Using JSON in JavaScript

JavaScript provides built-in methods for working with JSON data:

- **`JSON.stringify(object)`:** Converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
  This is useful for sending data to a server.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

const jsonString = JSON.stringify(person);
console.log(jsonString); // Output: {"name":"Alice","age":25}
```

- **`JSON.parse(jsonString)`:** Parses a JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object.
  This is useful for receiving data from a server.

```javascript
const jsonString2 = '{"name":"Bob","age":30}';
const person2 = JSON.parse(jsonString2);
console.log(person2.name); // Output: Bob
console.log(person2.age); // Output: 30
```

## Fetching JSON Data from a Server

The `fetch()` API is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.
You can use `fetch()` to retrieve JSON data from a server:

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data.name);
    console.log(data.email);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  });
```

This code fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API (a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping) and logs the user's name and email to the console.

## Sending JSON Data to a Server

You can also use `fetch()` to send JSON data to a server:

```javascript
const newUser = {
  name: "Charlie",
  age: 35,
};

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(newUser),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("New user created:", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error creating user:", error);
  });
```

This code sends a new user object to the JSONPlaceholder API using the `POST` method.
The `Content-Type` header is set to `"application/json"` to indicate that the request body is in JSON format.

## Why Use JSON?

JSON is a widely used data format for web applications because it is:

- **Lightweight:** JSON data is compact and easy to transmit over the internet.
- **Human-Readable:** JSON data is relatively easy to read and understand.
- **Easy to Parse:** JSON data can be easily parsed by most programming languages.
- **Widely Supported:** JSON is supported by most web browsers and server-side technologies.

## Practice and Explore

JSON is an essential skill for any web developer.
Practice working with JSON data in JavaScript.
Experiment with `JSON.stringify()`, `JSON.parse()`, and the `fetch()` API.
The more you use JSON, the better you'll understand how to communicate with servers and build data-driven web applications.
