You've learned that authentication and authorization are essential for securing your web applications.
Let's dive deeper into **authentication**, the process of verifying a user's identity.
Authentication answers the question: "Who are you?"

Think of authentication as presenting your ID card at the entrance of a building.
You need to prove that you are who you claim to be before you're allowed to enter.

## The Authentication Process

The basic authentication process typically involves the following steps:

1.  **User Provides Credentials:** The user enters their credentials, typically a username and password, into a login form.
2.  **Credentials Sent to Server:** The front-end sends the credentials to the back-end over a secure connection (HTTPS).
3.  **Server Verifies Credentials:** The server retrieves the user's stored credentials from the database (usually a hashed password).
4.  **Server Generates Session:** If the credentials are valid, the server creates a session for the user and sends a session identifier (e.g., a cookie or a JWT) back to the client.
5.  **Client Stores Session Identifier:** The client stores the session identifier and includes it in subsequent requests to the server.
6.  **Server Authenticates Requests:** For each subsequent request, the server verifies the session identifier to authenticate the user.

## Common Authentication Methods

There are several common authentication methods:

- **Username and Password:** The traditional method of authentication.
  It is strongly recommended to NOT use this type due to its inherent security vulnerabilities.
  - **Pros:** Simple to implement and widely understood.
  - **Cons:** Vulnerable to brute-force attacks, phishing, and password reuse.
  - **Best Practices:**
    - Use strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
    - Hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
    - Enforce password resets regularly.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication.
  - **Pros:** Significantly increases security compared to username and password alone.
  - **Cons:** Can be more complex to implement and may require additional hardware or software.
  - **Examples:**
    - **One-Time Passwords (OTPs):** Sent via SMS or generated by an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
    - **Push Notifications:** Users receive a push notification on their device to approve or deny the login attempt.
    - **Email Verification:** Users receive an email with a verification link or code to confirm their identity.
- **OAuth 2.0:** A standard protocol for delegated authorization, allowing users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials.
  - **Pros:** Secure, allows users to control which data they share with third-party applications.
  - **Cons:** More complex to implement than username and password authentication.
  - **Use Cases:** Allowing users to log in to your application using their Google, Facebook, or Twitter accounts.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular and secure way to represent claims between two parties.
They are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

- **What is a JWT?:** A JWT is a compact, URL-safe JSON object that contains information about the user (claims).
- **How JWTs Work:**
  1.  The server authenticates the user and generates a JWT containing information about the user (e.g., user ID, roles, permissions).
  2.  The server signs the JWT using a secret key or a public/private key pair.
  3.  The server sends the JWT back to the client.
  4.  The client stores the JWT (typically in local storage or a cookie) and includes it in subsequent requests.
  5.  The server verifies the JWT's signature to authenticate the user and extracts the claims from the JWT to authorize access to resources.
- **Benefits of JWTs:**
  - **Stateless:** JWTs are self-contained and don't require the server to store session information.
  - **Scalable:** JWTs can be easily distributed across multiple servers.
  - **Secure:** JWTs can be digitally signed to prevent tampering.

## Remember

Authentication verifies who the user _is_.
Choose an authentication method that matches the sensitivity of your data and the risk profile of your application.
It's important to implement security best practices to protect against common authentication vulnerabilities.
