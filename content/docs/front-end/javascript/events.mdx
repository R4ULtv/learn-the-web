description: Responding to User Interactions
---

You've learned how to access and manipulate HTML elements using the DOM.
Now, let's make your web pages truly interactive by responding to user actions with **events**.
Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as button clicks, mouse movements, form submissions, and page loads.
JavaScript allows you to "listen" for these events and execute code in response.

## What are Events?

Events are signals that are fired by the browser when something interesting happens.
These signals can be triggered by user actions, such as:

- Clicking a button
- Moving the mouse
- Typing in a text field
- Submitting a form
- Loading a page

Events can also be triggered by the browser itself, such as:

- The page finishing loading
- An error occurring

## Event Listeners

To respond to an event, you need to attach an **event listener** to an HTML element.
An event listener is a function that will be executed when a specific event occurs on that element.

There are several ways to attach event listeners in JavaScript:

### Inline Handlers (Not Recommended)

You can add event handlers directly to HTML elements using event attributes:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

However, this approach is generally _not_ recommended for standard HTML and JavaScript projects because it mixes HTML and JavaScript, making your code harder to maintain.
This is different if you are using a framework like React, where these inline handlers are compiled and handled differently.

### DOM Listeners (Recommended)

The preferred way to attach event listeners is to use the `addEventListener()` method of the DOM element:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

The `addEventListener()` method takes two arguments:

1.  The name of the event to listen for (e.g., `"click"`, `"mouseover"`, `"submit"`).
2.  The function to be executed when the event occurs (the _event handler_).

You can also use an arrow function as the event handler:

```javascript
const button2 = document.querySelector("#myButton");

button2.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button 2 clicked!");
});
```

### Removing Listeners

You can remove an event listener using the `removeEventListener()` method:

```javascript
function handleClick() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
}

const button3 = document.querySelector("#myButton");
button3.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

// Later, remove the event listener
button3.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

**Important:** You must pass the _same_ function reference to `removeEventListener()` that you passed to `addEventListener()` for it to work.
This is why it's important to assign the event handler function to a variable.

## Common Events

Here are some of the most common events you'll use in JavaScript:

- **`click`:** Occurs when the user clicks on an element.
- **`mouseover`:** Occurs when the mouse pointer enters an element.
- **`mouseout`:** Occurs when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
- **`mousemove`:** Occurs when the mouse pointer is moving over an element.
- **`keydown`:** Occurs when the user presses a key down.
- **`keyup`:** Occurs when the user releases a key.
- **`submit`:** Occurs when a form is submitted.
- **`load`:** Occurs when the page or an element has finished loading.
- **`DOMContentLoaded`:** Occurs when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
  It is the preferred event to start adding event listeners.

## The Event Object

When an event occurs, the browser creates an **event object** and passes it as an argument to the event handler function.
The event object contains information about the event, such as:

- `target`: The element that triggered the event.
- `type`: The type of event that occurred (e.g., `"click"`, `"mouseover"`).
- `clientX` and `clientY`: The coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the browser window.
- `preventDefault()`: A method that prevents the default behavior of the event (e.g., preventing a form from submitting or a link from navigating).
- `stopPropagation()`: A method that stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree (more on this below).

```javascript
const button4 = document.querySelector("#myButton");

button4.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log("Event type:", event.type);
  console.log("Target element:", event.target);
});
```

## Practice and Explore

Events are the key to creating interactive web pages.
Practice attaching event listeners to different elements and responding to different events.
The more you work with events, the better you'll understand how to create engaging and responsive user experiences.
