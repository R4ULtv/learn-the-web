title: Authentication and Authorization
description: Securing Your Web Applications
---

In the world of web development, security is paramount.
You need to protect your application and its users from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
**Authentication** and **authorization** are two fundamental security mechanisms that work together to achieve this goal.

Think of authentication as verifying who someone is, like checking their ID at the door of a club.
Authorization, on the other hand, determines what they are allowed to do once they are inside, like whether they have access to the VIP area or the dance floor.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

In this section, you'll explore the essential concepts and techniques for implementing authentication and authorization in your web applications:

- **What is Authentication?:** Understanding the process of verifying a user's identity.
- **What is Authorization?:** Understanding the process of controlling access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- **Authentication Methods:** Learning about different authentication methods, such as:
  - **Username and Password:** The traditional method of authentication.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adding an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication.
  - **OAuth 2.0:** A standard protocol for delegated authorization, allowing users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources.
  - **Social Login:** Allowing users to authenticate using their existing accounts on social media platforms.
- **Authorization Models:** Exploring different authorization models, such as:
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigning permissions to roles and then assigning users to those roles.
  - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Controlling access based on attributes of the user, the resource, and the environment.
- **Session Management:** Understanding how to maintain user sessions across multiple requests.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Learning about JWTs, a popular and secure way to represent claims between two parties.
- **Security Best Practices:** Exploring general security best practices to ensure the security of your authentication and authorization implementation.

## Why Authentication and Authorization Matter

Authentication and authorization are essential for building secure web applications because they:

- **Protect User Data:** Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user information.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Actions:** Ensure that users can only perform actions that they are authorized to perform.
- **Maintain Data Integrity:** Prevent malicious users from modifying or deleting data.
- **Build Trust:** Establish trust with your users by demonstrating that you take security seriously.
