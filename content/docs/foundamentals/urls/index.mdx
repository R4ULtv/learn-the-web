title: URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
description: Your Guide to Web Resources
---

You've explored how devices find each other on the internet (IP addresses) and how human-readable names get translated into those addresses (DNS). Now, let's look at the addresses _you_ actually use when browsing: **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**. URLs are the strings you type into your browser's address bar or click on as links to access web pages, images, videos - everything online.

## What is a URL?

A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is like the complete address for something on the web. It tells your browser _how_ to get to a resource, _where_ that resource is located, and _which_ specific resource you want. Think of it as a very precise postal address, specifying not just the city and street, but also the exact building and apartment number.

Without URLs, navigating the web would be incredibly difficult. Imagine having to remember the exact location of every file on every server! URLs provide a standardized, user-friendly way to access anything online.

## A Quick Look at URL Structure

A URL isn't just a random string of characters; it's made up of several parts, each with a specific meaning. Here's a very basic example:

```
https://www.example.com/page.html
```

This URL tells the browser:

- `https://`: Use the secure HTTP protocol.

- `www.example.com`: Go to the website "example.com".

- `/page.html`: Find the file named "page.html".

We'll break down all the parts of a URL in detail later, but for now, just understand that each part plays a role in locating the correct resource.
