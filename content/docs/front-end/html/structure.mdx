description: Building the Skeleton of Your Web Page

You've now learned about individual HTML [elements](./elements) - the building blocks of web pages. But just like a pile of bricks doesn't make a house, a bunch of HTML elements doesn't make a well-structured web page. This section is about how to combine those elements to create the overall _structure_ of your document - the skeleton that holds everything together.

## The Basic HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document should follow a basic structure. This structure provides essential information to the browser and helps organize your content. Here's the fundamental template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your page content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's break down each part:

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** This is the _doctype declaration_. It's _not_ an HTML element, but a special instruction that tells the browser which version of HTML you're using. In this case, it tells the browser to use HTML5 (the latest and greatest version). Always include this at the very top of your HTML documents.
- **`<html>`:** This is the _root element_ of your HTML document. All other elements are contained within this element.
  - **`lang` attribute:** We specify the principal language for this document.
- **`<head>`:** This section contains _metadata_ about the document - information that is _not_ displayed on the page itself, but is used by the browser, search engines, and other services. Common elements inside `<head>` include:

  - **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`:** Specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is the most common and recommended encoding, as it supports a wide range of characters.
  - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`:** This is _crucially important_ for responsive design (making your website look good on different screen sizes). It tells the browser how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. Include this in all your web pages.
  - **`<title>`:** Specifies the title of the web page. This is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, and it's also used by search engines. _Every_ HTML document should have a `<title>` element.
  - **`<link>`:** Used to link to external resources, most commonly CSS stylesheets.
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    ```
  - **`<style>`:** Allows you to embed CSS directly within your HTML document (though it's generally better to use external stylesheets).
  - **`<script>`:** Used to include JavaScript code (either inline or by linking to an external file). Often placed at the end of the `<body>` for performance reasons.
  - **`<meta>`:** Can contains other kind of metadata like: `description`, `keywords`, `author`...

- **`<body>`:** This section contains the _visible_ content of the web page - everything that users will see and interact with. This includes text, images, links, forms, and all the other elements you learned about in the previous section.

## Structuring Content Within the `<body>`

The `<body>` element is where you build the actual content of your page. You use a combination of block-level and inline elements to create the structure. Here are some key principles:

- **Use Headings Hierarchically:** Use `<h1>` through `<h6>` to structure your content logically. Think of it like an outline:
  - `<h1>`: The main heading of the page (usually only one per page).
  - `<h2>`: Major subheadings.
  - `<h3>`: Subheadings within `<h2>` sections.
  - And so on...
- **Use Paragraphs for Text:** Wrap blocks of text in `<p>` elements.
- **Group Related Elements:** Use `<div>` elements to group related elements together, creating logical sections within your page. You can then use CSS to style these sections.
- **Use Semantic Elements:** Whenever possible, use _semantic_ HTML elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) to give meaning to your content. We'll cover these in detail in the [Semantics](./semantics) page. These are better than using just `<div>` elements everywhere.

## Example: A Simple Web Page Structure

Here's an example of how you might structure a simple web page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Awesome Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
      <article>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a web developer passionate about...</p>
        <img src="me.jpg" alt="A picture of me" />
      </article>

      <aside>
        <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Post 1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Post 2</a></li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2023 My Website</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

This example demonstrates:

- The basic HTML document structure.
- The use of semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`).
- Headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and an image.
- Indentation to make the code readable.
- Linking to an external CSS file (`style.css`).

## The Importance of Good Structure

A well-structured HTML document is:

- **Easier to Read and Maintain:** Clean, indented code with semantic elements is much easier to understand and modify than a jumbled mess of `<div>` elements.
- **Better for Accessibility:** Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on the structure of your HTML to understand and present the content to users with disabilities.
- **Improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines use the structure of your HTML to understand the content and relevance of your page.
- **Foundation for CSS and JavaScript:** A well-structured document makes it much easier to apply CSS styles and JavaScript behavior to specific elements or sections of your page.

In essence, a well-structured HTML document is the foundation of a well-built website. It's like the blueprints for your digital house - get it right, and everything else will be much easier. Don't just throw elements onto the page randomly; think about the overall structure and how the different parts relate to each other.
