title: Request Methods
description: Actions on the Web

You've learned that HTTP is the language clients and servers use to communicate, based on a request-response cycle. Now, let's focus on a crucial part of the _request_: the **request method** (also sometimes called a _verb_). The request method tells the server _what action_ the client wants to perform on the specified resource.

Think of it like this: you (the client) want to interact with a book (the resource) in a library (the server). You could:

- **Read** the book (GET).
- **Write** a new book (POST).
- **Replace** the entire book with a new edition (PUT).
- **Partially update** the book, like correcting a typo (PATCH).
- **Delete** the book (DELETE).

HTTP request methods are similar - they specify the _kind_ of interaction the client wants to have with the resource.

## Common HTTP Request Methods

While there are several HTTP request methods, some are used much more frequently than others. Here are the most important ones:

- **GET:**

  - This is the most common method. It's used to _retrieve_ data from the server.
  - When you type a URL into your browser and press Enter, you're usually making a GET request.
  - GET requests should only retrieve data; they should _not_ have any side effects (like modifying data on the server). This is an important principle called _idempotency_.
  - GET requests can include parameters in the URL's query string.

- **POST:**

  - This method is used to _send_ data to the server to create or update a resource.
  - POST requests are often used for form submissions (like logging in, submitting a comment, or placing an order).
  - The data being sent is included in the _body_ of the request, not in the URL. This allows for sending larger amounts of data and keeps sensitive information (like passwords) out of the URL.
  - Unlike GET requests, POST requests are _not_ necessarily idempotent. Making the same POST request multiple times might have different effects (e.g., creating multiple copies of a resource).

- **PUT:**

  - This method is used to _replace_ an existing resource with the data provided in the request.
  - It's like completely overwriting a file on the server.
  - PUT requests are _idempotent_. Making the same PUT request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once.

- **DELETE:**

  - This method is used to _delete_ a specified resource.
  - DELETE requests are also _idempotent_.

- **PATCH:**

  - Used to _partially modify_ a resource.
  - Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH applies only the changes specified in the request.
    For example, if you were updating a user profile, a PATCH request might only include the fields that have changed (like the user's email address), rather than sending the entire profile.

- **HEAD:**

  - Similar to GET, but the server only returns the _headers_ of the response, not the actual content (the body).
  - Useful for checking if a resource exists, getting metadata about the resource (like its size or last modified date), or testing the validity of a link, without actually downloading the resource itself.

- **OPTIONS:**
  - Used to retrieve the communication options available for a resource or the server in general.
  - The server responds with a list of the HTTP methods it supports for the specified resource.

## Choosing the Right Method

Choosing the correct HTTP request method is important for several reasons:

- **Semantics:** Using the correct method makes your API (Application Programming Interface) more predictable and easier to understand. It clearly communicates the _intent_ of the request.
- **Idempotency:** Understanding the idempotency of different methods is crucial for ensuring that your application behaves correctly, especially in situations where requests might be retried (e.g., due to network errors).
- **Caching:** Browsers and other intermediaries can cache GET requests, improving performance. POST, PUT, and DELETE requests are typically not cached.
- **Security:** Some security vulnerabilities can arise from using the wrong HTTP method. For example, using GET to perform actions that modify data on the server can be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

## Request Methods in Practice

As a web developer, you'll use HTTP request methods constantly:

- **Front-End Development:** When you create forms, you'll specify the HTTP method (usually GET or POST) to be used when the form is submitted. When you use JavaScript to make requests to the server (e.g., using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`), you'll also specify the method.
- **Back-End Development:** Your server-side code will need to handle different HTTP request methods. For example, you might have different code to handle a GET request (to retrieve data) and a POST request (to create or update data) for the same URL.
- **API Design:** When designing APIs, you'll choose the appropriate HTTP method for each endpoint based on the action it performs.

Understanding HTTP request methods is fundamental to building web applications that communicate effectively and follow best practices. They are the verbs of the web, defining the actions that clients can perform on resources.
