description: Diving Deeper into HTML Tags

In the [HTML introduction](../html), you learned that HTML uses tags to structure content. Now, let's get into the specifics of those tags - the **elements** that make up every web page. Think of them as the individual bricks that, when put together, build a complete structure.

## Anatomy of an HTML Element

Let's revisit the basic structure. Most HTML elements have three parts:

1.  **Opening Tag:** This marks the beginning of the element. It's enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and contains the element's name (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`).
2.  **Content:** This is the actual stuff that the element contains. It could be text, other HTML elements, or a combination of both.
3.  **Closing Tag:** This marks the end of the element. It's identical to the opening tag, but with a forward slash (`/`) before the element name (e.g., `</p>`, `</h1>`, `</a>`).

Here's the paragraph example again:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

`<p>` is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph of text." is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag. Simple, right?

## Common HTML Elements: Your Toolbox

There are _many_ different HTML elements, each with a specific purpose. You don't need to memorize them all at once! We'll focus on the most common and important ones, the ones you'll use constantly. You can categorize HTML elements.

### Text Content

- **`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`:** These are heading elements, used to create headings of different levels. `<h1>` is the most important (largest), and `<h6>` is the least important (smallest). Use them hierarchically to structure your content.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Section Heading</h3>
```

- **`<p>`:** The paragraph element. Use it for blocks of text. Browsers automatically add some spacing between paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
```

- **`<span>`:** An inline element used to group text or other inline elements _without_ adding any line breaks or inherent styling. It's often used with CSS to style specific parts of a text.

```html
<p>This is a sentence with a <span style="color: blue;">blue word</span>.</p>
```

- **`<br>`:** A self-closing element that inserts a line break. Use this sparingly; often, other elements (like `<p>`) are better for structuring content.

```html
<p>This is the first line.<br />This is the second line.</p>
```

### Grouping Content

- **`<div>`:** A block-level element used to group other elements together. It doesn't have any inherent styling or meaning on its own, but it's very useful for structuring your layout and applying CSS styles. Think of it as a generic container.

```html
<div>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Paragraph of text.</p>
</div>
```

- **`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`:** These are _semantic_ elements, meaning they have specific meanings that describe the content they contain. They help structure your page logically and improve accessibility and SEO. We'll cover these in more detail in the [Semantics](./semantics) section.

### Lists

- **`<ul>`:** Creates an unordered list (a bulleted list).
- **`<ol>`:** Creates an ordered list (a numbered list).
- **`<li>`:** Represents a list item. Used inside `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>First step</li>
  <li>Second step</li>
  <li>Third step</li>
</ol>
```

### Links and Images

- **`<a>`:** The anchor element. Used to create hyperlinks to other web pages, files, email addresses, or locations within the same page. The `href` attribute specifies the destination of the link.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
<a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
<a href="#section2">Jump to Section 2</a>
```

- **`<img>`:** A self-closing element used to embed images. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for screen readers and if the image fails to load.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" />
```

### Forms

- **`<form>`:** Creates a form for user input.
- **`<input>`:** A versatile element used for various types of input fields (text, password, email, checkbox, radio button, etc.). The `type` attribute specifies the input type.
- **`<textarea>`:** Creates a multi-line text input field.
- **`<button>`:** Creates a clickable button.
- **`<select>`:** Creates a dropdown list.
- **`<option>`:** Represents an option within a `<select>` element.

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" /><br /><br />

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" /><br /><br />

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea><br /><br />

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

### Tables

- **`<table>`**: Creates a table
- **`<tr>`**: Table row
- **`<th>`**: Table header
- **`<td>`**: Table data cell
- **`<thead>`**: Table head
- **`<tbody>`**: Table body
- **`<tfoot>`**: Table foot

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header content 1</th>
      <th>Header content 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Body content 1</td>
      <td>Body content 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Embedded Content

- **`<iframe>`**: Creates an embedded frame that allows you to display content from another webpage within your current page.
  This element acts like a window to external content, letting you incorporate things like YouTube videos, Google Maps, or other web pages directly into your site without requiring users to navigate away.
  The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the content to embed.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com"></iframe>
```

## Nesting Elements

You can _nest_ HTML elements inside other elements. This is how you create complex structures. For example, you might put a list (`<ul>`) inside a `<div>`, or put a `<strong>` element inside a `<p>`.

```html
<div>
  <h1>My List</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2 <strong>(Important!)</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

_Indentation_ is your friend! Use it to make your nested HTML code easy to read and understand. The browser doesn't care about indentation, but _you_ will, and so will anyone else who looks at your code.

## Block-Level vs. Inline Elements

HTML elements are generally categorized as either _block-level_ or _inline_:

- **Block-level elements:** Always start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<form>`.
- **Inline elements:** Do _not_ start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`.

You can change the default display behavior of elements using CSS (we'll get to that later!), but understanding the default behavior is important.

## Empty Elements (Self-Closing Tags)

As you saw with `<img>` and `<br>`, some elements don't have any content between an opening and closing tag. These are called _empty elements_ (or _void elements_ or _self-closing tags_). They have a single tag that acts as both the opening and closing tag. You can optionally add a forward slash before the closing angle bracket (e.g., `<img src="..." />`), but it's not required in HTML5.

## Keep Learning and Experimenting!

This is just a starting point. There are many more HTML elements to discover, and the best way to learn is by experimenting. Try creating different elements, nesting them, and seeing how they look in your browser. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn! And use online resources like the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) to look up specific elements and their attributes. It's your best friend for web development.
