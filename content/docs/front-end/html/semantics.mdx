title: Semantics
description: Giving Meaning to Your HTML
---

You've learned about HTML [elements](./elements) and how to [structure](./structure) your document. Now, let's talk about _semantics_ - one of the most important concepts in modern HTML. Semantic HTML is about using HTML elements to describe the _meaning_ of your content, not just its appearance.

## What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML means using HTML elements for their intended purpose, based on what they _represent_, not just how they look by default. It's about choosing the _right_ element for the job, even if a different element might look the same visually (before you add CSS).

For example, you _could_ make any text bold by wrapping it in a `<div>` and applying CSS. But if that text is _strongly important_, you should use the `<strong>` element instead. `<strong>` is semantically correct - it conveys the _meaning_ of strong importance.

## Why Does Semantics Matter?

There are several _huge_ benefits to using semantic HTML:

1.  **Accessibility:** This is the most important reason. Screen readers (used by visually impaired users) rely heavily on semantic HTML to understand the structure and meaning of your content. If you use elements incorrectly, screen readers might misinterpret your page, making it difficult or impossible for users to navigate and understand. For example, a screen reader knows that an `<h1>` is a main heading and can announce it as such, helping users understand the page's organization.
2.  **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines (like Google) also use semantic HTML to understand the content and relevance of your web pages. Using elements correctly can improve your search engine rankings. For instance, Google will give more weight to text within an `<h1>` than text within a plain `<div>`.
3.  **Readability and Maintainability:** Semantic HTML makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. When you see a `<nav>` element, you immediately know it contains navigation links. If you just saw a bunch of `<div>` elements, it would be much harder to figure out what's going on. This is a big win for you and anyone else who works on your code.
4.  **Code Reusability:** Semantic HTML promotes more consistent and reusable code. If you consistently use elements correctly, it's easier to apply CSS styles and JavaScript behavior in a predictable way.
5.  **Future-Proofing:** Browsers and web standards evolve. Semantic HTML is more likely to be interpreted correctly by future browsers and technologies.

## Common Semantic Elements

HTML5 introduced a number of semantic elements that greatly improve the ability to structure web pages meaningfully. Here are some of the most important ones:

- **`<header>`:** Represents introductory content for a section or the entire page. Often contains a heading, logo, navigation, or search form. You can have multiple `<header>` elements on a page (e.g., one for the main page header and one for each article).

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <nav>...</nav>
</header>
```

- **`<nav>`:** Represents a section containing navigation links. This could be the main site navigation, a table of contents, or a set of related links within an article.

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

- **`<main>`:** Represents the main content of the document. There should only be _one_ `<main>` element per page. It helps screen readers and search engines quickly identify the primary content.

```html
<main>
  <article>...</article>
  <article>...</article>
</main>
```

- **`<article>`:** Represents a self-contained composition within a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g., a blog post, news article, forum post, or product listing.

```html
<article>
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>Article content...</p>
</article>
```

- **`<aside>`:** Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it. Often used for sidebars, pull quotes, advertising, or groups of navigation links.

```html
<aside>
  <h3>Related Links</h3>
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</aside>
```

- **`<footer>`:** Represents a footer for a section or the entire page. Typically contains information about the author, copyright, related links, or contact information. You can have multiple `<footer>` elements on a page.

```html
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2023 My Website</p>
</footer>
```

- **`<section>`:** Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Use sections to break up your content into logical chunks. Don't use `<section>` if there is not a natural heading for it.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>...</p>
</section>
```

- **`<figure>` and `<figcaption>`:** Used to encapsulate a media element (like an image, video, or code snippet) and its caption.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />
  <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- **`<time>`:** Represents a specific time or date.

```html
<time datetime="2023-10-27">October 27, 2023</time>
```

- **`<mark>`:** Represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes

```html
<p>Search results for <mark>highlighted text</mark>.</p>
```

## Semantic vs. Non-Semantic Elements

Here's a table summarizing the difference between some common semantic and non-semantic elements:

| Semantic Element | Non-Semantic Equivalent | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<header>`       | `<div>`                 | Introductory content for a section or page.                                    |
| `<nav>`          | `<div>`                 | Navigation links.                                                              |
| `<main>`         | `<div>`                 | The main content of the document.                                              |
| `<article>`      | `<div>`                 | A self-contained composition (e.g., blog post).                                |
| `<aside>`        | `<div>`                 | Tangentially related content (e.g., sidebar).                                  |
| `<footer>`       | `<div>`                 | Footer for a section or page.                                                  |
| `<strong>`       | `<b>`                   | Strong importance (usually displayed as bold). `<b>` is purely presentational. |
| `<em>`           | `<i>`                   | Emphasis (usually displayed as italics). `<i>` is purely presentational.       |
| `<section>`      | `<div>`                 | Thematic group of content.                                                     |

**Key takeaway:** Avoid using `<div>` and `<span>` as your primary structuring elements. Use them only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<div>` is a generic block-level container, and `<span>` is a generic inline container. They have _no_ semantic meaning.

## Putting It All Together: A Semantic Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Semantic Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My Awesome Blog</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
      <article>
        <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
        <p>Published on <time datetime="2023-10-27">October 27, 2023</time></p>
        <p>
          This is the content of my first blog post. It's
          <strong>very important</strong>!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="image.jpg" alt="A relevant image" />
          <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <section>
          <h2>First Section</h2>
          <p>Content of section 1.</p>
        </section>
      </article>

      <aside>
        <h3>Recent Posts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Post 1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Post 2</a></li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2023 My Blog</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

This example uses semantic elements throughout, making the code more meaningful, accessible, and SEO-friendly. It's a much better approach than using generic `<div>` and `<span>` elements for everything.

Semantic HTML is a cornerstone of good web development. By using elements for their intended purposes, you create websites that are more accessible, maintainable, and perform better in search engines. It's a win-win-win situation! Always prioritize semantic correctness when writing your HTML.
