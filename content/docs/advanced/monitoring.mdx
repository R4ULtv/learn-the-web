You've deployed your application to the cloud and automated the release process.
Now, how do you know if it's actually healthy, performing well, and meeting your users' needs? This is where robust **monitoring, observability, and alerting** come into play.
These practices are essential for proactively identifying and addressing issues before they impact your users.

## Why is Monitoring, Observability, and Alerting Important?

- **Proactive Problem Detection:** Identify issues before they impact users.
- **Performance Optimization:** Pinpoint performance bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization.
- **Faster Incident Response:** Reduce the time to detect and resolve incidents.
- **Improved Reliability:** Increase application uptime and reduce errors.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Provide insights into user behavior and application usage.
- **Reduce Support Costs:** Solve the issues early.

## Key Concepts

- **Monitoring:** Collecting and analyzing metrics about the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure.
- **Observability:** Going beyond basic metrics to provide deeper insights into the internal state of your systems, enabling you to understand _why_ issues are occurring.
- **Alerting:** Automatically notifying the appropriate personnel when critical issues are detected.

## Pillars of Observability

Observability is often described in terms of three key "pillars":

- **Metrics:** Numerical measurements of system behavior over time (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage, request latency, error rates).
- **Logs:** Textual records of events that occur within your application (e.g., application errors, user actions, system events).
- **Traces:** End-to-end views of a request as it flows through your system, showing the sequence of operations and the time spent in each component.

## Monitoring Strategies

- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Monitoring the health and performance of your servers, networks, and other infrastructure components.
  - Examples: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
- **Application Monitoring:** Monitoring the performance and behavior of your application code.
  - Examples: Request latency, error rates, database query times, API response times.
- **Business Metrics Monitoring:** Tracking key business metrics to understand the impact of application performance on business outcomes.
  - Examples: User sign-ups, order completion rates, revenue, customer satisfaction.
- **Synthetic Monitoring:** Simulating user interactions to proactively test the availability and performance of your application.
  - Examples: Simulating a user logging in, browsing products, and placing an order.

## Tools and Technologies

  - [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/): Part of the all-in-one platform for monitoring, logging, and alerting.

## Setting Up Alerts

Alerts should be configured to notify the appropriate personnel when critical issues are detected.
Here are some best practices for setting up alerts:

- **Define Clear Thresholds:** Set thresholds for metrics that indicate a problem.
  For example, alert if CPU usage exceeds 90% or if error rates exceed 5%.
- **Prioritize Alerts:** Classify alerts based on their severity.
  For example, use "critical," "warning," and "informational" levels.
- **Route Alerts to the Right People:** Send alerts to the teams or individuals who are responsible for resolving the issue.
- **Provide Context:** Include as much information as possible in the alert message, such as the affected service, the metric that triggered the alert, and the time of the incident.
- **Avoid Alert Fatigue:** Tune your alert rules to minimize false positives.
  Too many alerts can lead to alert fatigue, where people start ignoring alerts.

## Important Considerations

- **Choose the Right Tools:** Select tools that fit your specific needs and budget.
- **Automate Configuration:** Use infrastructure-as-code tools to automate the deployment and configuration of your monitoring infrastructure.
- **Regularly Review and Tune Alerts:** Regularly review your alert rules to ensure that they are still relevant and effective.
- **Establish Clear Incident Response Procedures:** Define clear procedures for responding to incidents, including who is responsible for what and how to escalate issues.
- **Consider log retention policies.**

By implementing a comprehensive monitoring, observability, and alerting strategy, you can ensure the health and performance of your applications, reduce downtime, and improve the overall user experience.
