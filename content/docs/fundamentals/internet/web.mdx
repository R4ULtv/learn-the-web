You've already learned about the _internet_ - that vast network of connections, addresses, and communication rules.
Now, let's dive into the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, often shortened to just "the Web."
While many people use "internet" and "Web" as the same thing, it's crucial to understand that the Web is just _one_ of the many services that utilize the internet's infrastructure.

## What Is the Web?

Think of the internet as a vast ocean. The Web, then, is like all the ships sailing upon that ocean. It's an enormous collection of interconnected documents and resources.
These resources primarily consist of web pages, which are documents written in a language called HTML.
Websites are collections of these related web pages, usually grouped under a single domain name, such as `google.com` or `wikipedia.org`.
The magic that connects all these pages and websites together is hyperlinks - those clickable links, often underlined and blue, that transport you from one page to another, even across different servers located around the world.

## How Does the Web Work?

So, how does this whole web-surfing process actually work? Let's break it down. It all starts with you, the client.
You open a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge on your computer, phone, or tablet.
Then, you either type a web address, known as a URL (for example, `https://www.example.com`), into the browser's address bar, or you click on a link.
This action sends a request out onto the internet.
For a more in-depth look at this process, see the [request-response cycle](../client-server#the-request-response-cycle).

Before your request can reach the correct server, a crucial step happens: a [DNS lookup](../ip-and-dns/dns).
The internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate that human-readable web address (like `www.example.com`) into the server's numerical IP address (something like `192.168.1.1`).
You can think of DNS as the internet's phone book.

Once the IP address is found, your request travels across the internet, utilizing the TCP/IP protocols we discussed earlier, until it reaches the server hosting the website you're trying to access.
A server is essentially a powerful computer specifically designed to store web pages and respond to requests from browsers.

Your browser and the server communicate using a language called [HTTP](../http). HTTP defines the format of requests and responses, establishing a set of rules for their interaction.
The server locates the specific web page you requested and sends it back to your browser as an HTTP response.
This response includes the HTML code that makes up the page, along with any associated images, videos, or other necessary resources.

Your browser then takes over, receiving the HTML code and interpreting it. This process is called "rendering."
The browser displays the text, images, and other elements according to the instructions within the HTML and CSS, which dictate the page's visual appearance.
And finally, the web page appears on your screen, ready for you to interact with it!

## Key Web Technologies

Several key technologies are fundamental to the functioning of the Web. HTML serves as the basic building block of web pages.
It uses _tags_ to structure the content, defining headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Think of it as the skeleton of a web page.
CSS controls the _styling_ of web pages - everything from colors and fonts to layout and overall design.
It's like the skin and clothing, giving the page its visual style. JavaScript, a programming language, adds _interactivity_ to web pages.
It enables actions like responding to button clicks, form submissions, or mouse movements, making web pages dynamic and responsive.
And, of course, there are [URLs](../urls) - the web addresses you use to navigate the Web.

## The Web is Dynamic

The Web is constantly evolving. New websites are launched, pages are updated, and links are created continuously.
This dynamic nature is a key part of what makes the Web so powerful and valuable.
Technologies like JavaScript contribute to making web pages interactive and responsive, leading to a richer and more engaging user experience.

## Summary: Internet vs. Web (Again!)

To repeat the crucial distinction: The _internet_ is the underlying infrastructure - the network, the physical connections, the addressing system (IP addresses), and the rules for communication (TCP/IP).
The _Web_, on the other hand, is a _service_ that operates _on top of_ the internet.
It's the system of interconnected web pages, websites, and hyperlinks that you access and navigate using a web browser.
Understanding this difference is fundamental for any aspiring web developer, as you're not simply building for the internet; you're building for the Web, a specific and sophisticated system built upon the internet's foundation.
