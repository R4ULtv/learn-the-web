description: Storing and Managing Your Application's Data
---

You've learned how server-side languages handle logic and process requests.
But where does your application store its persistent data â€“ user accounts, product catalogs, blog posts, and everything else that needs to be remembered between sessions? That's where **databases** come in.

Think of a database as a digital filing cabinet, optimized for storing, organizing, and retrieving large amounts of structured data.
Without a database, your application would be limited to temporary data that disappears when the server restarts.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

In this section, you'll explore the world of databases, learning:

- **What a Database Is:** Understanding the fundamental concepts of data storage and management.
- **Database Types: Relational vs. NoSQL:** Exploring the two main categories of databases and their respective strengths and weaknesses.
- **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):** Learning about popular RDBMSs like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
- **NoSQL Databases:** Discovering NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis, each tailored to specific use cases.
- **Database Design:** Understanding how to design effective database schemas to optimize performance and data integrity.
- **Querying Data:** Learning how to retrieve data from databases using SQL (for relational databases) and other query languages (for NoSQL databases).
- **Database Management and Administration:** Exploring tasks like backup, recovery, and performance tuning.

## The Importance of Databases

Databases are essential for building modern web applications.
They enable you to:

- **Store Persistent Data:** Save data that needs to be retained between sessions.
- **Organize Data Efficiently:** Structure data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve, update, and delete.
- **Ensure Data Integrity:** Enforce rules to ensure the consistency and accuracy of data.
- **Handle Large Volumes of Data:** Scale to handle growing amounts of data as your application becomes more popular.
