In the world of web development, security is paramount.
You need to protect your application and its users from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
**Authentication** and **authorization** are two fundamental security mechanisms that work together to achieve this goal.

Think of authentication as verifying who someone is, like checking their ID at the door of a club.
Authorization, on the other hand, determines what they are allowed to do once they are inside, like whether they have access to the VIP area or the dance floor.

## What You'll Learn in This Section

This section will guide you through the essential concepts and techniques for implementing authentication and authorization in your web applications.
We'll cover:

- **Authentication:** Understanding how to verify a user's identity.
- **Authorization:** Learning how to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- **Authentication Methods:**
  - Traditional username and password setups.
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
